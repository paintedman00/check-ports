# open-port
This script will check the open ports on the localhost and print a message for each port that is open or closed. You can also specify the hostname of a remote server to check the open ports on that server. For example, to check the open ports on the server www.example.com, you would type the following command:


```bash
bash OpenPorts.sh www.example.com
